        <p>When deciding on the tech stack for this portfolio, React was the obvious choice. Its component-based architecture allowed me to build reusable UI elements, like the project cards and experience items, which saved a significant amount of time.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the power of state management with hooks like `useState` made complex interactions, such as the expandable details sections, surprisingly straightforward to implement. This modularity is not just a developer convenience; it leads to a more maintainable and scalable application.</p>

        <p>As a developer with a passion for product management, I believe it's crucial for engineers to understand the 'why' behind what they're building. Itâ€™s not just about writing functional code; it's about solving a real user problem.</p>
        <p>This means asking questions like: Who is our user? What are their pain points? How will this feature deliver value? By embedding this product-centric mindset into the development process, we can build not just features, but experiences that users truly love.</p>
