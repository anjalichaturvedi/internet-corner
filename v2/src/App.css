/* src/App.css --- The Correct and Final Layout Styles */

/* 1. The top-level container for the entire application */
.portfolio-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column; /* Stacks Navbar on top of the app-body */
  
  /* THIS IS KEY: Lock the container to the full height of the viewport */
  height: 115vh; 
  
  /* THIS IS KEY: Prevent this container itself from ever getting a scrollbar */
  overflow: hidden; 
  
  background-color: #000;
}

/* 2. The container that holds the two columns (Sidebar and Main Content) */
.app-body {
  display: grid;
  /* Defines the two columns: 350px for sidebar, 1fr for the rest */
  grid-template-columns: 350px 1fr; 
  
  /* THIS IS KEY: Make this container fill all remaining vertical space */
  flex-grow: 1; 
  
  /* THIS IS KEY: Also prevent this container from scrolling */
  overflow: hidden; 
}

/* 3. The main content area on the right */
.main-content {
  /* THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART: */
  /* Allow ONLY this container to scroll vertically if its content is too long */
  overflow-y: auto; 
  
  background: linear-gradient(#222, #121212);
}

/* 4. Ensure the sidebar can also scroll independently if its content gets long */
/* The class name here should match the root element in your Sidebar.js file */
.sidebar-container {
  overflow-y: auto;
}
